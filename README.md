# IBB_Assignment2
Second assignment for Image-Based Biometry

## Requirements

This assignment was made in Matlab with the following toolboxes:

* Deep Learning Toolbox
* Computer Vision Toolbox

## Running the program

I would recommend running only the testCNN.m program since it shows testing and evaluation. I wouldn't recommend running the trainCNN.m since it might take some time to complete. But feel free to check out the code.
